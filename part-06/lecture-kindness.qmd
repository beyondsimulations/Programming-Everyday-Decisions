## [Computational Kindness]{.invert-font} {background-color="#000000" background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549925245-f20a1bac6454?q=80&w=2304&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

. . .

[[Question:]{.question} **An idea what that is?**]{.invert-font}

. . .

::: {.invert-font}

- Idea of introducing [empathy in algorithms]{.highlight}
- **Consider human cognitive load and limitations**
- Making choices that **reduce mental burden** for others
- Creating systems that are **easy to understand and interact**
:::

::: {.footer}
:::


## Scheduling Meetings

- [Propose specific times!]{.highlight}
- Don't ask "when are you free?"
- **Reduces** cognitive load for others
- **Transforms** an open-ended problem

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
**Now a simple yes/no decision!**
:::

## Communication

- [Be explicit rather than implicit]{.highlight}
- Provide **clear** options instead
- **Avoid** open-ended questions
- State your **preferences** 

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
**Avoid** deferring → "I'm fine with [whatever]{.highlight}"!
:::

## The Cost of Flexibility

- "I'm free whenever" seems helpful 
- Being too flexible can be **unhelpful**
- [But it is not!]{.highlight}
  - Forces others to **consider all possibilities**
  - **Increases** cognitive load
  - Makes decision-making **more complex**

## Principles

1. **Reduce Options**: Fewer choices lead to [better decisions]{.highlight}
2. **Be Explicit**: Clear constraints [help]{.highlight} others decide
3. **Consider Cognitive Load**: Design interactions minimizing [mental effort]{.highlight} for others
4. **Make Decisions**: [Taking responsibility]{.highlight} can be kind

# [Key Concepts]{.flow}

## Topics from the Lecture

- **Optimal Stopping**: How to decide [when to stop looking]{.highlight} for better options.
- **Explore/Exploit Tradeoff**: [Balancing]{.highlight} between trying new things and sticking with known options.
- **Caching**: Storing and reusing information by [sticking to a task]{.highlight} to improve performance.
- **Scheduling**: Efficiently managing [tasks and time.]{.highlight}
- **Randomness**: Understanding and working with [uncertainty.]{.highlight}

# [How to continue?]{.flow} {.title}

## [How to continue learning?]{.invert-font} {background-color="#000000" background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1547190027-9156686aa2f0?q=80&w=3540&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3DD" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

::: {.invert-font}

- We have covered **a lot of topics**
- But there are **many more** to explore!

:::

## Bayes' Rule

- Fundamental theorem in probability theory
- Updates probability of hypothesis based on [new evidence]{.highlight}
- Used in **statistics, machine learning, and decision-making**

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
Helps make **informed predictions and decisions** under uncertainty in the real world!
:::

## Overfitting

- Occurs when a model [learns the training data too well]{.highlight}
- **Captures noise and outliers** rather than pattern
- Results in **poor generalization to new data**

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
Several ways to counter overfitting, e.g. cross-validation.
:::

## Game Theory

- Strategic interactions among [rational decision-makers]{.highlight}
- Analyzes situations with **multiple agents** and their strategies

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
**Many applications** in economics, politics, and biology!
:::

## Networking

- Study of **information exchange** over networks
- Includes [understanding protocols and data transmission]{.highlight}
- Optimizes **network resources**

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
**Important** in computer networks, the internet and social life!
:::

## Relaxation

- Simplifies [complex problems]{.highlight} to make them more tractable
- Involves **relaxing certain constraints**
- Provides insights or **approximate** solutions

## How to continue programming?

- The best way to continue learning is to [keep programming in the future]{.highlight}
- Potentially, you will continue to do so during your studies
- Coding in your Thesis is a another great way to improve
- Try to find a way to apply programming in your work
- **There are many interesting topics to explore!**

## Advent of Code

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun way to keep programming
- Here you can solve programming puzzles during Advent
- It is **completely free** and ad-free and starts each year at 01.12.

## That's it for the Lecture Series!

- We now have covered the basics of Python
- I hope you enjoyed the lecture and found it helpful
- If you have questions or feedback, [please let me know!]{.highlight}
- I wish you all the best for your studies and your career!

# [Q&A]{.flow}

# [Literature]{.flow} {.title}

## Interesting literature to start

- Christian, B., & Griffiths, T. (2016). Algorithms to live by: the computer science of human decisions. First international edition. New York, Henry Holt and Company.[^4]

[^4]: The main inspiration for this lecture. Nils and I have read it and discussed it in depth, always wanting to translate it into a course.


## Books on Programming

- Downey, A. B. (2024). Think Python: How to think like a computer scientist (Third edition). O’Reilly. [Here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/)
- Elter, S. (2021). Schrödinger programmiert Python: Das etwas andere Fachbuch (1. Auflage). Rheinwerk Verlag.

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Think Python is a great book to start with. It's available online for free. Schrödinger Programmiert Python is a great alternative for German students, as it is a very playful introduction to programming with lots of examples.
