# Introduction

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide on understanding packages and package management in Julia! 

Think of packages as pre-written sets of tools that extend what Julia can do. It's like having a toolbox where you can add new tools (packages) to help you solve specific problems. For example, there are packages for working with data, creating visualizations, or solving complex math problems.

The best part? Most Julia packages are free to use, thanks to the open-source community!

::: {.callout-note}
While we'll practice some commands here, you'll typically manage packages in Julia's REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which is like Julia's command center.
:::

# Section 1 - Using the Package Manager

Julia's built-in package manager, Pkg, provides a robust set of tools for managing packages. To utilize these tools, start by importing the Pkg module. This module allows you to add, update, and remove packages, and manage environments efficiently. Note, `import PackageName` lets you access exported functions with `PackageName.function`, while `using PackageName` imports all exported names into the local namespace for direct access.

## Exercise 1.1 - Import the Pkg Module

Import the Pkg module to start managing packages effectively.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
# YOUR CODE BELOW

```
```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# Test your answer
try 
    Pkg.update()
    println("Pkg module imported successfully and packages were updated!")
catch e
    @error "The Pkg module was not imported yet! Have you used the correct syntax?"
end
```

# Section 2 - Adding Packages

Adding packages in Julia is straightforward using the `Pkg.add("PackageName")` function. Replace `PackageName` with the actual package name you wish to add.

## Exercise 2.1 - Add the DataFrames Package

Let's add a popular package called DataFrames. It's great for working with structured data, like spreadsheets.

```{julia}
# YOUR CODE BELOW

```
```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# Test your answer
try 
    using DataFrames
    println("Package added successfully!")
catch e
    @error "Package was not added yet! Have you used the correct syntax?"
end
```

# Section 3 - Updating and Removing Packages

Just like apps on your phone, packages can be updated or removed when you no longer need them.

- To update a package: `Pkg.update("PackageName")`
- To update all packages: `Pkg.update()`
- To remove a package: `Pkg.rm("PackageName")`

::: {.callout-example}
If you wanted to update DataFrames, you'd use `Pkg.update("DataFrames")`.
To remove it, you'd use `Pkg.rm("DataFrames")`.
:::

# Section 4 - Managing Environments

Think of environments as separate workspaces for different projects. It's like having different folders for different school subjects. It's a best practice to create a new environment for each project to avoid conflicts between package versions. Activate a new environment with `Pkg.activate("new_environment")` and add packages to it with `Pkg.add("PackageName")`. This ensures that each of your projects has a clean, dedicated set of dependencies. When you create a new environment, Julia generates two important files:

1. `Project.toml`: Lists direct dependencies of your project.
2. `Manifest.toml`: Contains a complete dependency graph of your project.

These files help ensure reproducibility and should be version controlled with your project. But don't worry, you don't have to worry about this yet.

::: {.callout-note}
If you plan to stick to working with notebooks, you don't have to care about environments yet. Just use the regular environment for the course and you don't have to activate anything.
