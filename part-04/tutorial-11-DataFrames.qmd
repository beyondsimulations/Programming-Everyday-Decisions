# Introduction

Imagine a DataFrame as a digital spreadsheet. It's a way to organize and work with data in rows and columns. Each column can hold different types of information, like names, ages, or salaries. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create DataFrames, add and change data, and perform simple operations on our data.

::: {.callout-note}
Before we start, make sure you have the DataFrames package installed. If you're not sure how to do this, check the previous tutorial on package management!
:::

Let's begin by importing the DataFrames package:

```{julia}
#| eval: true
# Import the DataFrames package
using DataFrames
```

# Section 1 - Creating DataFrames

A DataFrame in Julia is akin to a table in SQL or a spreadsheet - each column can have its own type, making it highly versatile. A DataFrame can be created using the DataFrame constructor and passing key-value pairs where the key is the column name and the value is an array of data. For more help, use `?` in the REPL and type `DataFrame`. Example:

```{julia}
students = DataFrame(
    Name = ["Elio", "Bob", "Yola"], 
    Age = [18, 25,29], 
)
```

## Exercise 1.1 - Create a DataFrame

Create and Test a DataFrame. Create a DataFrame named `employees` with the columns `Name`, `Age`, and `Salary`, and populate it with the specified data: John is `28` years old and earns `50000`, Mike is `23` years old and earns `62000`. Frank is `37` years old and earns `90000`.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
# YOUR CODE BELOW

```
```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# Test your answer
@assert employees == DataFrame(
    Name = ["John", "Mike", "Frank"], 
    Age = [28, 23, 37], 
    Salary = [50000, 62000, 90000]
)
println("DataFrame created successfully!")
println(employees)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Remember, for more help, use `?` in the REPL and type `DataFrame`.
:::

# Section 2 - Accessing and Modifying Data

Accessing columns in a DataFrame can be done using the dot syntax, while rows can be accessed via indexing. Modification of data is straightforward; just assign a new value to the desired cell. To access the column 'name' in our DataFrame with `employees`, we could do:

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
using DataFrames
employees = DataFrame(
    Name = ["John", "Mike", "Frank"], 
    Age = [28, 23, 37], 
    Salary = [50000, 62000, 90000]
)
```

```{julia}
employees.Name 
```

To access the third name specifically, we could do:

```{julia}
employees.Name[3] 
```

## Exercise 2.1 - Access the `Age` Column

Access the `Age` column from the DataFrame and save it in a new variable `ages`.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
# YOUR CODE BELOW

```
```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# Test your answer
@assert ages == [28, 23, 37]
println("Correct, the Ages column is: ", ages)
```

## Exercise 2.2 - Update John's Salary

Update John's salary to `59000`.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
# YOUR CODE BELOW

```
```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# Test your answer
@assert employees.Salary[1] == 59000
println("Modified DataFrame: ")
println(employees)
```

# Section 3 - Filtering Data

Logical indexing can be used to filter rows in a DataFrame based on conditions. To filter the DataFrame to include only employees names "Frank" we could do:

```{julia}
allFranks = employees[employees.Name .== "Frank", :]
```

Alternatively, the filter function provides a powerful tool to extract subsets of 
data based on a condition:

```{julia}
allFranks = filter(row -> row.Name == "Frank", employees) 
```

## Exercise 3.1 - Filter the DataFrame

Filter the DataFrame to include only employees with salaries above `60000`. Save the resulting employees in the DataFrame `high_earners`. 

```{julia}
#| eval: false
# YOUR CODE BELOW

```
```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# Test your answer
@assert nrow(high_earners) == 2
println("High earners: ")
println(high_earners)
```

# Section 4 - Basic Data Manipulation

Julia provides functions for basic data manipulation tasks, including sorting, grouping, and joining DataFrames. The `sort` function can be used to order the rows in a DataFrame based on the values in one or more columns. To see how to use the function, type `?` into the REPL (terminal) and type `sort`.

## Exercise 4.1 - Sort the DataFrame

Sort the DataFrame based on the `Age` column and save it as `sorted_df`.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
# YOUR CODE BELOW

```
```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# Test your answer
@assert sorted_df.Age[1] == 23
println("DataFrame sorted by age: ")
println(sorted_df)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you have more complicated data structures, take a look at JSON files which can be used to work with all kind of differently structured data sets. 
:::

# Section 5 - Loop over DataFrames

Sometimes, you might need to iterate over the rows of a DataFrame to perform operations on each row individually. Julia provides a convenient way to do this using the `eachrow` function. For example, if we want to check for each employee if they have a salary above 60000, we can do the following:

```{julia}
for row in eachrow(employees)
    if row.Salary > 60000
        println("$(row.Name) earns more than 60000")
    end
end
```

Here, the `row` holds all the values of the row as a `NamedTuple`. We can access the values of a column then by using the dot syntax. To create a new column, we can use the `push!` function. For example, to create a new column called `VacationDays` in the `employees` DataFrame, we can do one of the following:

```{julia}
employees.VacationDays = [0 for row in eachrow(employees)]
employees.VacationDays .= 0
```

## Exercise 5.1 - Loop over DataFrame

Create a new column called `Bonus` in the `employees` DataFrame. The bonus should be calculated as 10% of the salary for employees over 30, and 5% for those 30 and under. Use a loop to iterate over the rows and calculate the bonus.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
# YOUR CODE BELOW

```
```{julia}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# Test your answer
@assert filter(
    row -> row.Bonus == 2950, 
    employees
).Name == ["John"] "John should have a bonus of 2950"
@assert filter(
    row -> row.Bonus == 3100, 
    employees
).Name == ["Mike"] "Mike should have a bonus of 3100"
@assert filter(
    row -> row.Bonus == 9000, 
    employees
).Name == ["Frank"] "Frank should have a bonus of 9000"
println("Great job! All the bonuses are correct!")
```

# Section 6 - Filling a new DataFrame with values

Do you remember the `push!` function? We can use it to fill a new DataFrame with values. For example, we can create a new DataFrame called `WorkingHours` and fill it with the values from the `employees` DataFrame. Imagine that the company has a policy, where employees above 30 work 30 hours a week, and employees under 30 work 40 hours a week:

```{julia}
# Create a new DataFrame
WorkingHours = DataFrame(
    Name = String[],
    Hours = Int[]
)
# Loop over the rows of the employees DataFrame
for row in eachrow(employees)
    if row.Age < 30
        push!(WorkingHours, (
            Name = row.Name, 
            Hours = 40
        ))
    else
        push!(WorkingHours, (
            Name = row.Name, 
            Hours = 30
        ))
    end
end
println(WorkingHours)
```
