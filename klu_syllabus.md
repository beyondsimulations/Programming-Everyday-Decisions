## Course Overview

This course explores the intersection of computer science and everyday life by examining how algorithms can be applied to improve decision-making in various contexts. Based on the book "Algorithms to Live By" by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, the course will cover topics such as optimal stopping, scheduling, caching, and game theory, providing both theoretical foundations and practical programming exercises.

**Important Note:** This module is specifically designed for business students. It does not require any technical expertise or prior knowledge and accounts for the different levels of competence students may already have.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the course, students will:

- Understand fundamental algorithms and their applications to everyday problems
- Develop the ability to model real-world scenarios using algorithmic thinking
- Implement simple algorithms in Python to solve practical problems
- Analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of different algorithms in various contexts

## Programming Environment

This course uses **Python 3** as our primary programming language. To ensure everyone has a consistent development environment, we'll walk through the setup process together during our first session.

**What You Need to Bring:** Please bring your laptop to class. We'll guide you through the installation process step-by-step, regardless of whether you're using Windows, Mac, or Linux.

## Assessment & Grading

The course is **pass/fail only** and requires:

- **75% minimum attendance**
- **2 assignments** from the lecture
- **1 final presentation**

All assignments are due by the end of the quarter (earlier submissions are highly encouraged).

### Assignment Requirements

- Each assignment focuses on an algorithmic problem from the course
- Must be solved independently
- At least **50% of solutions must be correct**
- Brief presentation required at the end
- **Collaboration allowed** in groups of up to 3 students
- More details will be provided at the introductory lecture
