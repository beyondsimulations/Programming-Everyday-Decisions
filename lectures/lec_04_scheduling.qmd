# [Scheduling Fundamentals]{.flow} {.title}

## A Simple Scheduling Problem

![](https://images.beyondsimulations.com/atlb/atlb_schedule-washdry.svg)

## Washing Machine & Dryer

Let's solve this simple scheduling problem:

. . .

```{.python}
Task  Washing  Drying
  A    40min   60min
  B    30min   80min
  C    60min   20min
  D    50min   60min
```
. . .

[Goal:]{.highlight} **Minimize total time for washing and drying all loads**

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **An idea how to solve this?**

## Johnson's Rule

[Rule:]{.task} To find the [optimal solution]{.highlight}:

1. Find the job with **shortest duration**:
   - If on **Machine 1** → Schedule First
   - If on **Machine 2** → Schedule Last
   - If **equal** → Choose randomly

2. Remove job from list and **repeat**

## Applying Johnson's Rule {auto-animate=true}

```{.python}
Task  Washing  Drying  Schedule
  A    40min   60min
  B    30min   80min
  C    60min   20min
  D    50min   60min
```

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What's the first scheduled task?**

## Applying Johnson's Rule {auto-animate=true}

```{.python}
Task  Washing  Drying  Schedule
  A    40min   60min
  B    30min   80min
  C    60min   20min        4
  D    50min   60min
```

- **In Task C**, the dryer is the **shortest** task.
- It is on **Machine 2** → **Schedule Last**

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What's the next task?**

## Applying Johnson's Rule {auto-animate=true}

```{.python}
Task  Washing  Drying  Schedule
  A    40min   60min
  B    30min   80min        1
  C    60min   20min        4
  D    50min   60min
```

- **In Task B**, the washing machine is the **shortest** task.
- It is on **Machine 1** → **Schedule First**

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What's the next task?**

## Applying Johnson's Rule {auto-animate=true}

```{.python}
Task  Washing  Drying  Schedule
  A    40min   60min        2
  B    30min   80min        1
  C    60min   20min        4
  D    50min   60min
```

- **In Task A**, the washing machine is the **shortest** task.
- It is on **Machine 1** → **Schedule Second**

. . .

[Now, we only have one task left!]{.highlight}

## Applying Johnson's Rule {auto-animate=true}

```{.python}
Task  Washing  Drying  Schedule
  A    40min   60min        2
  B    30min   80min        1
  C    60min   20min        4
  D    50min   60min        3
```

## Priority Inheritance

[Question:]{.question} **How to handle with shortest processing time?**

::: {.incremental}

- [Rule:]{.task} Tasks inherit priority from their dependents.
- A gets the highest priority from B
- This ensures the **critical path completion**

:::

. . .

```python
Task  Duration  Priority
  A    20min     3
  B    30min     3
  C    30min     2
  D    30min     2
  E    30min     2
```

## EDD and Dependencies

[Question:]{.question} **What's was earliest due date again?**

. . .

- Sort the tasks by deadline, schedule equal tasks randomly
- Things get more complex when we add dependencies

. . .

```python
Task  Duration  Deadline  Predecessor
  A    40min    110min    None
  B    30min     90min    D
  C    60min    150min    A
  D    50min     70min    None
  E    30min    210min    C
```

[Question:]{.question} **Any ideas how to solve this?**



## Lawler's Algorithm

[Rule:]{.task} We can use **Lawler's Algorithm** (1968)

1. Consider all tasks [without successors]{.highlight}
2. Choose the one with **latest deadline**
3. Schedule the task **last**
4. **Remove** it from the network and start again

## Lawler's Applied {auto-animate=true}

```python
Task  Duration  Deadline  Predecessor Schedule
  A    40min    110min    None
  B    30min     90min    D
  C    60min    150min    A
  D    50min     70min    None
  E    30min    210min    C
```

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What's the schedule?**

## Lawler's Applied {auto-animate=true}

```python
Task  Duration  Deadline  Predecessor Schedule
  A    40min    110min    None
  B    30min     90min    D
  C    60min    150min    A
  D    50min     70min    None
  E    30min    210min    C             5
```

## Lawler's Applied {auto-animate=true}

```python

  A    40min    110min    None
  B    30min     90min    D
  C    60min    150min    A             4
  D    50min     70min    None
  E    30min    210min    C             5
```

## Lawler's Applied {auto-animate=true}

```python
Task  Duration  Deadline  Predecessor Schedule
  A    40min    110min    None
  B    30min     90min    D             3

  D    50min     70min    None
  E    30min    210min    C             5
```

## Lawler's Applied {auto-animate=true}

```python

  E    30min    210min    C             5
```

## Lawler's Applied {auto-animate=true}

```python
Task  Duration  Deadline  Predecessor Schedule
  A    40min    110min    None          1
  B    30min     90min    D             3

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What's the maximum delay?**

# [Difficulty of Scheduling]{.flow} {.title}

## SPT with Predecessors

- No solution in **polynomial time**
- [NP-hard problem]{.highlight} (no efficient algorithm)
- True for **most scheduling problems!**
- We can use **heuristics**, though

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What have we missed so far?**

# [Real-time Scheduling]{.flow} {.title}

## Interruptions

- In reality, we **cannot predict the future**
- We need to react to **new tasks** as they happen
- If we have a **deadline**, we might need to meet it
- Let's look at this for the [earliest due date objective]{.highlight}

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
## Quick reminder
An earliest due date is a specific point in time by which a task must be completed. Under this objective, we want to minimize the **maximum delay**.
:::

## Real-time EDD

8:00-12:00 Schedule:

```python
Task           Duration  Deadline
Email A        20min     9:00
Create PPT     60min    10:50
Investor call  10min     9:00
Email B        30min    10:20
Liquidity      40min    11:00
Email C        20min    11:20
Email D        40min    10:00
```

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Any ideas how to start with under the objective of the earliest due date?**

## EDD Rule for Real-time

[Rule:]{.task}

- Always schedule the task with the **earliest deadline**
- If a new task with an earlier deadline comes in, **re-schedule**
- Otherwise, stick to the original schedule.

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
## Equal Deadline
If a new task has the same deadline as the current task, you can choose either. But due to the cost of context switching, you might want to stick with the current task.

[Question:]{.question} **What's the maximum delay with this schedule?**

## SPT for Real-time

:::{.callout-tip}
## Quick reminder

A shortest processing time is the task with the shortest duration. Under this objective, we want to minimize the **total waiting time**.
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Any ideas how to start here?**

## SPT Rule for Real-time

[Rule:]{.task}

- Always schedule the task with the **shortest duration**
- If a new task with a shorter duration comes in, **re-schedule**
- Otherwise, stick to the original schedule.

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
## Equal Duration
If a new task has the same duration as the current task, you can choose either. But due to the cost of context switching, you might again want to stick with the current task.

# [Thrashing]{.flow} {.title}

## What is Thrashing?

- Excessive **context switching**
- Organization [overhead exceeds productivity]{.highlight}
- Maximum activity, minimum output

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Have you ever experienced this?**

## Thrashing Warning Signs

- Constant **task switching**
- **Nothing** getting completed
- Increasing **stress levels**
- Declining **quality**

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Any ideas how to prevent this?**

## Preventing Thrashing Strategic

:::{.callout-tip}
## Strategic
Strategic solutions focus on **long-term** changes to prevent thrashing.
:::

. . .

1. Task rejection/delegation threshold
2. Simplified organization systems
3. Minimum work period rules
4. Reduced reactivity requirements


## Preventing Thrashing Tactical

1. Time blocking
2. Focus periods
3. Task batching
4. Priority freezes

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What strategies have worked for you?**

# [Applying This Knowledge]{.flow} {.title}

## Immediate Applications

**How can you use these algorithms starting today?**

:::{.incremental}
- **Daily planning:** Use SPT for your to-do list to minimize waiting time
- **Project management:** Apply EDD when managing deadlines
- **Team coordination:** Use Johnson's Rule for two-stage processes
- **Time blocking:** Prevent thrashing with strategic scheduling
:::

## Key Takeaways

**What we learned today:**

:::{.incremental}
1. **Scheduling algorithms** provide optimal solutions to time management problems
2. **Different objectives** require different algorithms (EDD, SPT, Johnson's Rule)
3. **Dependencies and constraints** add complexity but have algorithmic solutions
4. **Thrashing prevention** is crucial for maintaining productivity
5. **These principles** directly translate to programming and system design
