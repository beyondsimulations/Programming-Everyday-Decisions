## A Quick Question First

:::{.fragment}
[Question:]{.question} **How many of you have a messy desktop right now?**
:::

:::{.fragment}
**Raise your hand!**
:::

:::{.fragment}
Today's lecture will explain why that matters more than you think...
:::

## Let's approach the topic using an everyday decision
:::{.incremental}
::: {layout="[[50,50]]"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- We have a problem: Our cupboard.
- It's time to put things in order.
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="text-align: center;"}

:::
:::
:::
:::

## [Question:]{.question} What could we do?
:::{.incremental}
::: {layout="[[50,50]]"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Better organization
- Clearing out things we no longer need
- Now we have two problems:
    - Storing?
    - Clearing out?
:::

:::

## Two Approaches to Storage Problems

:::{.incremental}
::: {layout="[[50,50]]"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Better Organization:**
    - Subdivide storage
    - Efficient sorting
- **More Space:**
    - Increase capacity
- [Question:]{.question} Which approach is better?
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="text-align: center;"}
![](../images/caching/closet_2.png)
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Even best organization has limits

:::{.incremental}
::: {layout="[[50,50]]"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Organization helps, but takes time.
- More space helps, but has limits.
- **Every storage has a finite capacity.**
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="text-align: center;"}
![](../images/caching/closet_2.png)
:::
:::
:::
:::

## [Question:]{.question} What do we do, when the storage is full?

:::{.fragment}
::: {style="text-align: center;"}

**We could increase the capacity**
:::
:::

## But...
:::{.incremental}
::: {layout="[[50,50]]"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Increasing capacity = costly
- **Trade-off:** Size vs. Speed
- Larger = slower to search
- Sooner or later: Still fills up

## [Question:]{.question} What else faces this problem?

:::{.incremental}
- Cupboards
- Computers
- Email inbox
- Smartphones
- Warehouses
- **Our brain?!**
:::

## [Question:]{.question} Impact of full storage?
:::{.incremental}
::: {layout="[[50,50]]"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Access speed drops
- Processing time up
- Performance down

# [Clearing out]{.flow} {.title}
## Why Clearing Out Matters

:::{.incremental}
- True for cupboards, computers, brains...
- **But what stays and what goes?**
:::

## Learning from Computer Science

:::{.fragment}
**The evolution of computer memory**
:::
:::{.incremental}
- 1950s: Computer science faced the same problem
- Processors got faster (Moore's Law)
- Memory demands grew
- But memory speed couldn't keep up

:::{.fragment}
**→ The Memory Wall**
:::
:::

## The Bottleneck

:::{.incremental}
- **Modern CPUs:** Billions of ops/second
- **Problem:** Data isn't available fast enough
- [Question:]{.question} What's the point of a fast CPU if it has to wait for slow memory?

:::{.fragment}
**→ Von Neumann Bottleneck**
:::
:::

# [Cache]{.flow} {.title}

## Cache: The Solution

:::{.fragment}
**A hierarchical memory system**
:::

:::{.incremental}
- **L1 Cache:** Tiny but ultra-fast (64-256 KB)
- **L2/L3 Cache:** Larger, still fast (MB range)
- **RAM:** Main workspace (8-32 GB)
- **Storage:** Huge but slow (256 GB - 2 TB)

:::{.fragment}
**Like a library...**
:::
:::

## The Library Principle

:::{.incremental}
::: {layout="[[50,50]]"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Library storage** (5 million books, Mass Storage)
- **Subject locations** (100K books, RAM)
- **Your desk** (5 borrowed books, L2)
- **Short-term memory** (current page, L1)

:::{.fragment}
**Closer = Faster = Smaller**
:::
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

:::
:::
:::

## The Trade-off: Size and Speed

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
![](https://i.imgur.com/suD65Rs.png){width="50%"}

**Registers are 10 million times faster than the hard drive!**

**Why can't we just make everything as fast as L1 cache?**
:::

## Why the Trade-off?

:::{.incremental}
**Why not make everything ultra-fast?**

- **Physical limits:** Larger caches sit further from CPU, signals take longer to travel, and dense fast memory generates extreme heat that must be dissipated
- **Economic limits:** SRAM costs $50,000/GB vs. HDDs at $0.02/GB
- **Solution:** Multiple cache levels, each optimized for different needs
:::

## The nessecity of clearing out

:::{.incremental}
::: {layout="[[50,50]]"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- L1 and L2 cache only contain most necessary data.
- The same should apply to your desk.
- Therefore, both must be cleared regularly.

# [Clearing out Strategies]{.flow} {.title}


## [Question:]{.question} Eviction Strategies?

:::{.incremental}
- Random
- First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
- Least Frequently Used (LFU)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
:::

## How to clear up?

:::{.incremental}
- **Optimal: Clairvoyance**
    - Keep what you'll need
    - Remove what you won't
- [Question:]{.question} What's the problem?

:::{.fragment}
**→ Requires knowledge of the future!**
:::
:::

## Realistic Strategies

:::{.incremental}
- **Least Recently Used (LRU)** is the dominant strategy.
- Evicts the least recently accessed item from the cache when space is needed.
- Leads to much better performance on average than, for example, random eviction.
- [Question:]{.question} Why do you think least recently used is the better strategy?
:::

## Why LRU Works: The Principle of Temporal Locality

:::{.incremental}
- **Temporal Locality:** Recent use → Likely need again soon
- **Examples:**
    - Books on your desk
    - Apps opened today
    - People texted this morning
- **Performance:** 80-90% hit rate (vs. 50-60% random)

:::{.fragment}
**Recent past predicts near future**
:::
:::

## Managerial and personal insights:

:::{.incremental}
- **Let go of unused things** → LRU principle
- **Keep things where used** → Spatial locality
- **Result:** Significant productivity increase

:::{.fragment}
**Marie Kondo = LRU for physical objects!**
:::
:::

## Spatial Locality

:::{.fragment}
[Question:]{.question} Can you think of examples where spatial locality is applied in your daily life?
:::

# [Productivity]{.flow} {.title}

## Our Brains are Caches

:::{.incremental}
- We've learned how computers manage limited cache space
- **But why does this matter for humans?**
- Your brain works remarkably similar to a computer cache:
    - Limited capacity for active information
    - Fast access to recently used information
    - Must constantly decide what to keep and what to forget
:::

## Cache Vulnerabilities

:::{.incremental}
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks** exploit cache limitations:
    - **Cache Flooding:** Overload with excessive requests
    - **Cache Poisoning:** Insert malicious data to evict important information
- These attacks overload a system with excessive requests or data.
- Causing it to slow down or crash.
- The system is forced to evict important data.
:::

## Productivity Killers

:::{.incremental}
- **Overload** (too much information, cache capacity exceeded)
- **Exhaustion** (too long without "cache clearing")
- **Context switching** (interruption of "flow", ~23 minutes to get back on track)
- **Distraction** (Cache Flooding: constant notifications, social media)
- **Misinformation** (Cache Poisoning: fake news, misleading information)
:::

## The Attention Crisis

:::{.incremental}
- **Technology & Social Media:** Designed to capture attention (Cache Flooding)
- **Constant Interruptions:** Notifications = Forced cache evictions
- **Result:** Reduced creativity, critical thinking, and productivity

:::{.fragment}
[Reflection:]{.question} How many times did you check your phone during this lecture?
:::
:::

## The Solution: Manage Your Mental Cache

:::{.incremental}
- Limit screen time and practice "monotasking" (Reduce cache thrashing).
- Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and mindful habits (Maintain cache performance).
- Create protected time for deep work (Prevent cache flooding).
- Be selective about what enters your attention (Smart cache management).
:::

# [Mitigation]{.flow} {.title}
## Mitigation

:::{.incremental}
- Distraction can hardly be avoided in today’s world but can be mitigated.
- This is particularly important for managers.
- This lecture is designed to raise your awareness of what you can do to keep your brain working efficiently.
- **Want to dive deeper? Read "Stolen Focus" by Johann Hari**
:::

## Awareness: Three Levels of Attention

:::{.incremental}
- **Spotlight** – Immediate goals – Focus (Your L1 Cache: What are you working on RIGHT NOW?)
- **Starlight** – Medium-term goals – Wishes (Your L2 Cache: What matters this week/month?)
- **Daylight** – Long-term goals – Values (Your Storage: What defines your life direction?)
:::

## Practical Strategies

:::{.incremental}
- **Prioritization:** What deserves to be in your mental cache?
- **Structure (Schedule):** Time-boxing prevents cache overflow
- **Breaks:** Regular "cache clearing" prevents exhaustion
- **Enable flow:** Dedicated workspace, manage notifications, clear communication
- **Meditation & exercise:** Maintenance routines for optimal cache performance
:::

## Cache Hierarchy for Workspace

:::{.incremental}
- **Hot Cache (On your desk):** Only items for current tasks (today)
- **Warm Cache (Nearby shelf/drawer):** This week's projects (this week)
- **Cold Storage (Archive/closet):** Everything else

:::{.fragment}
**→ The key principle:** If you haven't used it recently, move it away!
:::
:::

## Self-Assessment

[Question:]{.question} **Right now:**

:::{.incremental}
1. How many browser tabs do you have open? ___
2. How many notifications did you receive in the last hour? ___
3. How many unread emails in your inbox? ___

:::{.fragment}
**Do you see any risks of cache flooding?**

# [Key Takeaways]{.flow} {.title}

## Key Takeaways: The Concepts

:::{.incremental}
- **Caching is universal:** It applies to computers, organizations, and human cognition
- **The fundamental trade-off:** Fast storage is small, large storage is slow
- **LRU works because of temporal locality:** Recent past predicts near future
:::

## Key Takeaways: Your Life

:::{.incremental}
- **Your brain is a cache:** Limited capacity, vulnerable to flooding and poisoning
- **Protect your attention:** It's your scarcest and most valuable resource
- **Apply caching principles to life:** Keep what you use, remove what you don't
