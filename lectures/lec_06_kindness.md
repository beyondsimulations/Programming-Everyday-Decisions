# <span class="flow">Computational Kindness</span>

## <span class="invert-font">Computational Kindness</span>

. . .

<span class="invert-font"><span class="highlight">Question:</span> **An idea what that is?**</span>

. . .

-   Idea of introducing <span class="highlight">empathy in algorithms</span>
-   **Consider human cognitive load and limitations**
-   Making choices that **reduce mental burden** for others
-   Creating systems that are **easy to understand and interact**

## Scheduling Meetings

-   <span class="highlight">Propose specific times!</span>
-   Don't ask "when are you free?"
-   **Reduces** cognitive load for others
-   **Transforms** an open-ended problem

. . .

> **Important**
>
> **Now a simple yes/no decision!**

## Communication

-   <span class="highlight">Be explicit rather than implicit</span>
-   Provide **clear** options instead
-   **Avoid** open-ended questions
-   State your **preferences**

. . .

> **Important**
>
> **Avoid** deferring → "I'm fine with <span class="highlight">whatever</span>"!

## The Cost of Flexibility

-   "I'm free whenever" seems helpful
-   Being too flexible can be **unhelpful**
-   <span class="highlight">But it is not!</span>
    -   Forces others to **consider all possibilities**
    -   **Increases** cognitive load
    -   Makes decision-making **more complex**

## Principles

1.  **Reduce Options**: Fewer choices lead to <span class="highlight">better decisions</span>
2.  **Be Explicit**: Clear constraints <span class="highlight">help</span> others decide
3.  **Consider Cognitive Load**: Design interactions minimizing <span class="highlight">mental effort</span> for others
4.  **Make Decisions**: <span class="highlight">Taking responsibility</span> can be kind

# <span class="flow">Key Concepts</span>

## Topics from the Lecture

-   **Optimal Stopping**: How to decide <span class="highlight">when to stop looking</span> for better options.
-   **Explore/Exploit Tradeoff**: <span class="highlight">Balancing</span> between trying new things and sticking with known options.
-   **Caching**: Storing and reusing information by <span class="highlight">sticking to a task</span> to improve performance.
-   **Scheduling**: Efficiently managing <span class="highlight">tasks and time.</span>
-   **Randomness**: Understanding and working with <span class="highlight">uncertainty.</span>

# <span class="flow">How to continue?</span>

## <span class="invert-font">How to continue learning?</span>

-   We have covered **a lot of topics**
-   But there are **many more** to explore!

## Bayes' Rule

-   Fundamental theorem in probability theory
-   Updates probability of hypothesis based on <span class="highlight">new evidence</span>
-   Used in **statistics, machine learning, and decision-making**

. . .

> **Important**
>
> Helps make **informed predictions and decisions** under uncertainty in the real world!

## Overfitting

-   Occurs when a model <span class="highlight">learns the training data too well</span>
-   **Captures noise and outliers** rather than pattern
-   Results in **poor generalization to new data**

. . .

> **Important**
>
> Several ways to counter overfitting, e.g. cross-validation.

## Game Theory

-   Strategic interactions among <span class="highlight">rational decision-makers</span>
-   Analyzes situations with **multiple agents** and their strategies

. . .

> **Important**
>
> **Many applications** in economics, politics, and biology!

## Networking

-   Study of **information exchange** over networks
-   Includes <span class="highlight">understanding protocols and data transmission</span>
-   Optimizes **network resources**

. . .

> **Important**
>
> **Important** in computer networks, the internet and social life!

## Relaxation

-   Simplifies <span class="highlight">complex problems</span> to make them more tractable
-   Involves **relaxing certain constraints**
-   Provides insights or **approximate** solutions

## Continue programming?

-   The best way to continue learning is to <span class="highlight">keep programming in the future</span>
-   Potentially, you will continue to do so during your studies
-   Coding in your Thesis is a another great way to improve
-   Try to find a way to apply programming in your work
-   **There are many interesting topics to explore!**

## Advent of Code

-   [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun way to keep programming
-   Here you can solve programming puzzles during Advent
-   It is **completely free** and ad-free and starts each year at 01.12.

## That's it for the Lecture Series!

-   We now have covered the basics of Python
-   I hope you enjoyed the lecture and found it helpful
-   If you have questions or feedback, <span class="highlight">please let me know!</span>
-   I wish you all the best for your studies and your career!

# <span class="flow">Q&A</span>

# <span class="flow">Literature</span>

## Interesting literature to start

-   Christian, B., & Griffiths, T. (2016). Algorithms to live by: the computer science of human decisions. First international edition. New York, Henry Holt and Company.[^1]

## Books on Programming

-   Downey, A. B. (2024). Think Python: How to think like a computer scientist (Third edition). O'Reilly. [Here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/)
-   Elter, S. (2021). Schrödinger programmiert Python: Das etwas andere Fachbuch (1. Auflage). Rheinwerk Verlag.

. . .

> **Note**
>
> Think Python is a great book to start with. It's available online for free. Schrödinger Programmiert Python is a great alternative for German students, as it is a very playful introduction to programming with lots of examples.

## More Literature
