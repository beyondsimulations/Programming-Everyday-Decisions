## Today's Topic: Randomness & Probabilistic Algorithms

**Topic:** Understanding how randomness powers algorithms and decision-making in computer science and everyday life

. . .

**Why this matters:** Randomness isn't just about gambling. It's a powerful tool that makes computers faster, cryptography secure, and helps us solve problems. Today we'll learn how embracing uncertainty can lead to better solutions.

## Today's Agenda

1.  **Understanding Randomness** - From casinos to algorithms
2.  **Randomness in Daily Life** - Where we encounter it without realizing
3.  **Computer Science Applications** - Monte Carlo, simulated annealing, cryptography
4.  **Decision Making** - Using randomness to solve hard problems

## Types of Randomness

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Difference between true and pseudo-randomness?**

. . .

<span class="highlight">True Randomness</span>

-   Physical phenomena
-   Atmospheric noise
-   Radioactive decay
-   Quantum effects

<span class="highlight">Pseudo-randomness</span>

-   Deterministic algorithms
-   Seed-based generation
-   Repeatable sequences
-   Good enough for most uses

## Limits of Computation

<span class="question">Question:</span> **How many possible combinations exist in a shuffled deck of cards?**

``` python
import math
print(math.factorial(52))
```

    80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000

. . .

> **Important**
>
> Computing and evaluating all possible combinations is not feasible!

## Computational Limits

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Anybody ever heard of "Monte Carlo methods"?**

. . .

-   Developed in the **1940s for nuclear weapons research**
-   Nuclear fission chain reactions **were too complex**
-   Helped to <span class="highlight">evaluate the probabilities of different outcomes</span>
-   Named after **Monaco's famous casino**

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **How could we estimate π?**

## Estimating π

# <span class="flow">Decision Making</span>

## Travel Itinerary

<span class="question">Question:</span> **How and in which order would you visit 10 cities by plane with minimal total distance?**

``` python
import math
print(math.factorial(10))
```

    3628800

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be a strategy?**

## Brute Force

-   Try <span class="highlight">every possibility</span>
-   Total possible routes: 10! = **3,628,800**
-   **Guaranteed** to find best solution
-   If each check takes 1ms: **1 hour** to check all routes

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be the problem with this approach?**

## Time and Space Requirements

-   For 20 cities: 20! = **2.4 quintillion** routes
-   Would take **77 billion years** at 1ms per check!
-   **Time complexity** grows <span class="highlight">factorially</span>
-   **Memory requirements** increase with problem size

. . .

> **Important**
>
> **Not feasible for real-world problems!**

## Greedy Algorithm

-   **Example:** Always picking shortest next flight
-   Make **locally optimal** choices at each step
-   <span class="highlight">Never backtracks or reconsiders past decisions</span>
-   Fast execution & simple to implement
-   Can perform **poorly on complex problems**

## Hill Climbing

-   <span class="highlight">Iteratively improve solution</span> by making small changes
-   Like **climbing in fog**, can only see immediate surroundings
-   Don't know if **higher peaks** exist elsewhere
-   Can get stuck in **local optima**
-   No guarantee of finding **global best optima**

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **How would you escape a local optimum?**

## Simulated Annealing (SA)

-   Make random changes and **accept improvements**
-   Sometimes accept **worse solutions**
-   Gradually become **more selective**

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Why accept worse solutions sometimes?**

. . .

-   Randomness helps to escape **local optima**
-   Balances <span class="highlight">exploration vs. exploitation</span>

# <span class="flow">Randomness and Society</span>

## Thought Experiment

**What's more important for a society?**

. . .

<span class="highlight">Freedom</span>

-   Individual choice
-   Personal responsibility
-   Market-driven

<span class="highlight">Equality</span>

-   Shared resources
-   Social safety nets
-   Regulated systems

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Any problem with this question?**

## Veil of Ignorance

You might <span class="highlight">randomly</span> be:

-   Any gender identity and economic status
-   Any health condition and intelligence level
-   Any cultural background and religious belief

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **If you didn't know who you'd be born as, what kind of society would you design?**

## Key Considerations

-   **Individual stories:** Powerful but potentially misleading
-   **Statistics:** Comprehensive but can miss nuance
-   **Hidden diversity:** Important subgroups may be overlooked
-   **Small policy changes** <span class="highlight">can have cascading effects</span>

. . .

> **Important**
>
> But that's not all! We also need to measure **success** and **failure**!

## Measuring Success

-   **Mean happiness:** Average well-being
-   **Total happiness:** Utilitarian approach
-   **Median happiness:** Focus on the middle class
-   **Minimum happiness:** Protecting the most vulnerable

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What could be the problem with these measures?**

## Idea: Random Sampling

-   Randomly <span class="highlight">select a subset of the population</span>
-   Gather **diverse perspectives** from the sample
-   Better understand **needs** of population
-   **Reduce selection bias** and improve accuracy

. . .

<span class="question">Question:</span> **What is a selection bias?**

## Selection Bias

**Definition**: Selection bias occurs when the sample data you're analyzing <span class="highlight">isn't truly representative of the population</span> you're trying to study.

. . .

> **Famous Example**
>
> During WWII, engineers studied returning planes to determine where to add armor. Initially, they focused on areas with most bullet holes. Abraham Wald pointed out they should instead armor the areas with *no* bullet holes - those were the critical areas where planes didn't survive to return!

## Promoting Fairness

<span class="question">Question:</span> **How can randomness promote fairness?**

. . .

-   **Random allocation** of patients in clinical trials
-   **Random audits** for tax compliance
-   **Random assignment** of cases to judges
-   **Random order** of candidates on voting ballots

# <span class="flow">Uncertainty</span>

## Quick Poll

<span class="question">Question:</span> **Which would you prefer?**

-   **100% chance of winning 50 EUR**
-   **50% chance of winning 120 EUR**

. . .

> **Tip**
>
> Answer depends on your **risk aversion**!

## Decisions Under Uncertainty

<span class="question">Question:</span> **When should we embrace vs. reduce randomness?**

. . .

<span class="highlight">Embrace When</span>:

-   Exploring new solutions
-   Avoiding bias
-   Breaking deadlocks
-   Testing systems

<span class="highlight">Reduce When</span>:

-   Safety-critical systems
-   Financial transactions
-   Medical procedures
-   Legal proceedings

# <span class="flow">Takeaways</span>

## "Good Enough" Solutions

-   **Perfect is enemy of good**
    -   Remember Monte Carlo methods: **approximations work**
    -   Complete analysis often impossible
    -   <span class="highlight">Perfect information is rare</span>

. . .

> **Tip**
>
> Many real-world problems benefit from **embracing uncertainty** rather than fighting it!

## Opportunity Costs

-   <span class="highlight">Consider opportunity costs</span>
    -   Quick approximations enable faster decisions
    -   Balance accuracy vs. computation time
    -   Random sampling vs. complete enumeration

. . .

> **Tip**
>
> Many problems benefit from **fast, good-enough solutions** rather than perfect ones.
