# # Tutorial IV.II - Dictionaries
#
# Programming: Everyday Decision-Making Algorithms
#
# # Introduction
#
# Welcome to this tutorial on dictionaries in Python! In the realm of
# personal task scheduling, organizing tasks efficiently is crucial.
# Imagine managing your daily activities like checking emails, planning
# finances, and scheduling meetings. Python’s dictionaries can be a
# helpful tool for handling such tasks by allowing you to store and
# retrieve information using key-value pairs. As always, follow the
# structured instructions, implement your code in the designated blocks,
# and affirm your comprehension with `assert` statements.
#
# # Section 1 - Creating and Accessing Dictionaries
#
# Think of it this way:
#
# -   A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs
# -   Each key-value pair has a unique key (like for example the task
#     name)
# -   And an associated value (like for example the task’s priority level)
# -   Keys are unique, but values can be repeated
# -   Dictionaries can grow and shrink as needed
#
# Let’s see some examples:

# %%
# Creating a dictionary of tasks
tasks = {
    "Check Emails": 1,
    "Liquidity Planning": 2,
    "Team Meeting": 3
}
print(tasks)

# %% [markdown]
# To access the value associated with a key, you can use the following
# syntax:

# %%
print(tasks["Check Emails"])

# %% [markdown]
# New entries can be added to the dictionary or existing entries can be
# modified using the following syntax:

# %%
tasks["Team Meeting"] = 4
tasks["Answer Emails"] = 7
print(tasks)

# %% [markdown]
# To delete entries, you can use the `del()` function:

# %%
del(tasks["Answer Emails"])
print(tasks)

# %% [markdown]
# > **Warning**
# >
# > You will have to create the dictionary first before you can add new
# > entries to it!
#
# To check if a key exists in the dictionary, you can use the following
# syntax:

# %%
print("Check Emails" in tasks)

# %% [markdown]
# Furthermore, we can nest a dictionary in a dictionary:

# %%
# Creating a dictionary of projects
projects = {
    "Project Alpha": {"status": "In Progress", "deadline": "2023-12-31"},
    "Project Beta": {"status": "Completed", "deadline": "2023-06-30"}
}
print(f"The deadline of Project Alpha is {projects['Project Alpha']['deadline']}.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1.1 - Create and Modify a Dictionary
#
# Add a new task called “Prepare Presentation” with the priority level `5`
# to the existing `tasks` dictionary. Note, that you will have to execute
# the code cell above that creates the dictionary first before you can add
# the new task!

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Test your answer
assert "Prepare Presentation" in tasks, "The task 'Prepare Presentation' was not added to the dictionary."
print("Great! You've successfully added a new task to the tasks dictionary.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1.2 - Check if a Key Exists
#
# Check if the key “Team Meeting” exists in the `tasks` dictionary using
# the `in` operator and a conditional statement. If it exists, save the
# message: `'Team Meeting is in the dictionary'` to the variable
# `message`. If it does not exist, save the message:
# `'Team Meeting is not in the dictionary'` to the variable `message`.
# Finally, print the value of the `message` variable.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Test your answer
assert message == "Team Meeting is in the dictionary", "The message is not correct. It should be 'Team Meeting is in the dictionary'."
print("Great! You've successfully checked if a key exists in the dictionary.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1.3 - Change the Value of a Key
#
# Change the value associated with the key “Check Emails” to `6`.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Test your answer
assert tasks["Check Emails"] == 6, "The value associated with the key 'Check Emails' is not correct. It should be 6."
print("Great! You've successfully changed the value of a key in the dictionary.")

# %% [markdown]
# # Section 2 - Advanced Dictionary Operations
#
# Dictionaries can do more than just store simple information. Let’s
# explore some features.
#
# With the `keys()` method, you can get all the keys of a dictionary as a
# dictionary view object. You can convert it to a list using the `list()`
# function.

# %%
task_names = tasks.keys() # Get all keys
print("Tasks:", task_names) # Still a dictionary view object
print("Tasks as list:", list(task_names)) # Convert to a list

# %% [markdown]
# To get all the values from a dictionary, you can use the `values()`
# method to get a dictionary view object. Again, you can convert it to a
# list using the `list()` function.

# %%
all_deadlines = tasks.values()
print("All deadlines:", list(all_deadlines))

# %% [markdown]
# We can also loop through the dictionary using a `for` loop. To do so, we
# can use the `items()` method which returns a dictionary view object
# containing the individual key-value pairs of the dictionary.

# %%
for task, priority in tasks.items():
    print(f"Task: {task}, Priority: {priority}")

# %% [markdown]
# To check the length of a dictionary, you can use the `len()` function.

# %%
print(len(tasks))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 2.1 - Compute the Average Priority
#
# Compute the average priority of the tasks in the `tasks` dictionary.
# Save the result to the variable `average_priority`.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Test your answer
assert len(tasks) == 4, "The number of tasks is not correct. It should be 4 based on the previous excercises."
assert average_priority == 4.25, "The average priority is not correct. It should be 4.25."
print("Great! You've successfully computed the average priority of the tasks.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 2.2 - Get the Task with the Highest Priority
#
# Get the task with the highest priority from the `tasks` dictionary. Save
# the result to the variable `highest_priority_task`. Note, that a
# priority of 1 is the highest priority.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Test your answer
assert highest_priority_task == "Liquidity Planning", f"The task {highest_priority_task} as the task with the highest priority is not correct. It should be 'Liquidity Planning'."
print("Great! You've successfully gotten the task with the highest priority.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 2.3 - Remove a Task
#
# First, check if the key `"Liquidity Planning"` exists in the `tasks`
# dictionary. If it exists, remove it using the appropriate method.
#
# > **Tip**
# >
# > You can use the `del()` function to remove a key from a dictionary.

# %%
# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Test your answer
assert "Liquidity Planning" not in tasks, "The task 'Liquidity Planning' was not removed from the dictionary."
print("Great! You've successfully removed a task from the dictionary.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Conclusion
#
# Great! You’ve just navigated through the basics of dictionaries in
# Python. Dictionaries are powerful data structures that allow for
# efficient data organization and retrieval. Remember:
#
# -   Dictionaries can store information using key-value pairs
# -   Accessing them using keys is efficient and easier as accessing them
#     using indices
# -   Loops can iterate over dictionaries to perform operations on each
#     key-value pair
#
# # Solutions
#
# You will likely find solutions to most exercises online. However, we
# strongly encourage you to work on these exercises independently without
# searching explicitly for the exact answers to the exercises.
# Understanding someone else’s solution is very different from developing
# your own. Use the lecture notes and try to solve the exercises on your
# own. This approach will significantly enhance your learning and
# problem-solving skills.
#
# Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
# understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you
# encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with
# different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during
# class discussions.
#
# Later, you will find the solutions to these exercises online in the
# associated GitHub repository, but we will also quickly go over them next
# week. To access the solutions, click on the Github button on the lower
# right and search for the folder with today’s lecture and tutorial.
# Alternatively, you can ask ChatGPT or Claude to explain them to you. But
# please remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
# understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities.
