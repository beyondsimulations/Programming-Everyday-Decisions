# # Tutorial II.II - Loops
#
# Programming: Everyday Decision-Making Algorithms
#
# # Introduction
#
# Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow us to repeat a
# set of instructions multiple times. They’re essential for tasks that
# require processing large datasets, iterating through complex sequences,
# or automating repetitive processes. In the context of clinical trials,
# loops help us systematically analyze multiple treatments or patient
# outcomes.
#
# > **Note**
# >
# > If a cell is marked with `YOUR CODE BELOW`, you are expected to write
# > your code in that cell.
#
# # Section 1 - For Loops
#
# A `for` loop allows us to iterate through a sequence of items. In
# clinical trials, this is particularly useful when we need to process
# multiple treatments or patient outcomes. The basic syntax is:
#
# ``` python
# for item in sequence:
#     # do something with item
# ```
#
# Think of it like reviewing patient charts: instead of manually checking
# each chart, you can automate the process to review them one by one
# systematically. This is especially valuable when dealing with large
# clinical trials or multiple treatment groups. Example with treatment
# options:

# %%
treatments = ["Standard Drug", "New Drug A", "New Drug B"]
for treatment in treatments:
    print(f"Evaluating efficacy of {treatment}")

# %% [markdown]
# # Range in For Loops
#
# When you need to iterate a specific number of times, the `range()`
# function is invaluable. It generates a sequence of numbers. It can take
# up to three arguments:
#
# -   `start`: The starting number (inclusive)
# -   `stop`: The ending number (exclusive)
# -   `step`: The difference between each number in the sequence

# %%
# Visual representation of range
print("range(5):", list(range(5)))
print("range(1, 6):", list(range(1, 6)))
print("range(0, 10, 2):", list(range(0, 10, 2)))

# %% [markdown]
# We can then use this sequence in a `for` loop to iterate through the
# numbers.

# %%
# Simulate 5 trial phases
for phase in range(5):  # 0 to 4
    print(f"Starting Phase {phase + 1}")

# %%
# Range with start, stop, and step
for dose in range(100, 501, 100):  # 100 to 500 in steps of 100
    print(f"Testing dosage: {dose}mg")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Break and Continue Statements
#
# -   `break`: Immediately exits the loop
# -   `continue`: Skips to the next iteration

# %%
efficacy_scores = [65, 85, 45, 82, 58]
for score in efficacy_scores:
    if score < 50:  # Skip low efficacy treatments
        continue
    print(f"Treatment efficacy: {score}%")
    if score >= 85:  # We found a highly effective treatment!
        print("Found a promising treatment - consider focusing on this one!")
        break

# %% [markdown]
# ## Tuple Unpacking
#
# Tuple unpacking is a powerful feature that allows you to assign multiple
# variables in a single statement. It’s often used in `for` loops to
# access elements from a list or tuple. For example:

# %%
treatments = [("Standard Drug", 75), ("New Drug A", 85), ("Alternative B", 68), ("New Drug C", 92)]
for name, efficacy in treatments:
    print(f"Treatment: {name}, Efficacy: {efficacy}%")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1.1 - Count Adverse Events
#
# Track the number of treatments that had too many adverse events (more
# than 5) with a `for` loop. Add 1 to `high_adverse_count` for each
# treatment that had more than 5 adverse events.

# %%
adverse_events = [3, 7, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4]
high_adverse_count = 0

# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Assertions to verify your solution
assert isinstance(high_adverse_count, int), "high_adverse_count should be an integer"
assert high_adverse_count == 3, "There should be exactly 3 treatments with high adverse events"
print("Success! You've correctly counted the high adverse event treatments.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1.2 - Calculate Average Treatment Efficacy
#
# Calculate the average efficacy of the treatments using a `for` loop.
# First, add each rate to the total. Then, calculate the average by
# dividing the total by the number of treatments.

# %%
efficacy_rates = [78, 72, 85, 65, 80]
average_efficacy = 0
total = 0
# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Assertions to verify your solution
assert isinstance(average_efficacy, (int, float)), "average_efficacy should be a number"
assert average_efficacy == 76, "average_efficacy should be 76"
print("Success! Your average calculation is correct.")

# %% [markdown]
# > **Tip**
# >
# > -   Add each rate to the total
# > -   Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of
# >     treatments
# > -   Note that `len(efficacy_rates)` gives you the count of treatments
#
# ## Exercise 1.3 - Find Promising Treatments
#
# Add all treatments with an efficacy rate of at least 80% to the list
# `promising_treatments`.

# %%
treatments = [("Standard Drug", 75), ("New Drug A", 85), ("Alternative B", 68), ("New Drug C", 92)]
promising_treatments = []

# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Assertions to verify your solution
assert len(promising_treatments) == 2, "Should find exactly 2 promising treatments"
assert all(isinstance(t, str) for t in promising_treatments), "promising_treatments should contain strings"
assert "New Drug A" in promising_treatments, "New Drug A should be in promising_treatments"
print("Success! You've correctly identified the promising treatments.")

# %% [markdown]
# > **Tip**
# >
# > -   Each treatment is represented as a tuple: `(name, efficacy_rate)`
# > -   You need to check if the efficacy rate (second element) is ≥ 80%
# > -   If it meets the criteria, add the treatment name (first element)
# >     to `promising_treatments`
# > -   You could use tuple unpacking in your loop for cleaner code
#
# # Section 2 - While Loops
#
# While loops continue executing as long as a condition is true. They’re
# perfect for situations where we don’t know in advance how many
# iterations we’ll need, like finding an effective treatment. Think of
# them as running clinical trials until you either find a breakthrough
# treatment or run out of research funding.

# %%
resources = 100  # Starting research resources
treatments_tested = 0
current_best = 0

while resources > 0:
    print(f"Resources remaining: {resources}")
    resources -= 20  # Each trial phase costs 20 units
    treatments_tested += 1

print(f"Tested {treatments_tested} treatment variations")

# %% [markdown]
# We can also use them without specific conditions at the beginning:

# %%
trials = 0
while True:
    if trials > 5:
        break
    print(f"Trial {trials}")
    trials += 1

# %% [markdown]
# > **Note**
# >
# > While loops are particularly useful when:
# >
# > -   You don’t know how many iterations you’ll need
# > -   You’re looking for a specific outcome
# > -   You need to stop based on resource constraints
#
# Be careful with while loops! An infinite loop can crash your program:
#
# ``` python
# while True:  # Dangerous!
#     print("This will never end")
# ```
#
# > **Warning**
# >
# > Always ensure:
# >
# > -   The condition will eventually become false
# > -   Resources or counters are properly updated
# > -   You have a way to break out if needed
#
# ## Exercise 2.1 - Breakthrough Treatment
#
# Use a `while` loop to find the first treatment with an efficacy score of
# at least 88. Count the number of trials it takes to find this treatment
# and store it in the variable `trials`. Save the efficacy score of the
# breakthrough treatment in the variable `current_efficacy`. Note, that
# the `efficacy_scores` list is indexed from 0!

# %%
efficacy_scores = [72, 68, 78, 88, 71, 65, 59]
current_efficacy = 0
trials = 0

# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Assertions to verify your solution
assert trials == 4, "Should take exactly 4 trials to find the breakthrough"
assert current_efficacy == 88, "Should find efficacy score of 88"
print("Success! You've found the breakthrough treatment efficiently.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 2.2 - Resource Management
#
# Continue trials until either resources are depleted or a breakthrough
# (efficacy \>= 90) is found. Count the number of trials it takes to find
# this treatment and store it in the variable `trials_conducted`. Save the
# efficacy score of the breakthrough treatment in the variable
# `current_best`. Note, that the `efficacy_scores` list is indexed from 0!

# %%
resources = 100
cost_per_trial = 25
current_best = 0
trials_conducted = 0
efficacy_scores = [75, 82, 88, 92, 85, 78]  # Simulated trial results

# YOUR CODE BELOW

# %%
# Assertions to verify your solution
assert trials_conducted == 4, "Should conduct 4 trials"
assert current_best >= 90, "Should find a treatment with >= 90 efficacy"
assert resources >= 0, "Should not exceed resource limit"
print("Success! You've managed resources effectively.")

# %% [markdown]
# > **Tip**
# >
# > -   Track both resources and efficacy simultaneously
# > -   Stop if either:
# >     -   Resources fall below cost_per_trial
# >     -   A breakthrough treatment (≥ 90% efficacy) is found
# > -   Remember to deduct costs for each trial
#
# # Conclusion
#
# Excellent work! You’ve learned about two powerful loop structures in
# Python through the lens of clinical trials and treatment exploration:
#
# -   `for` loops help us:
#     -   Process data systematically
#     -   Analyze outcomes efficiently
#     -   Work with structured data like treatment efficacy rates
# -   `while` loops are perfect for:
#     -   Resource-constrained scenarios
#     -   Finding certain outcomes
#     -   Situations with unknown iteration counts
#
# In the context of clinical trials: - `for` loops are like reviewing a
# predetermined set of patient data - `while` loops are like continuing
# research until you either find a successful treatment or exhaust your
# resources
#
# These loop structures are fundamental tools, allowing us to process
# large datasets and make informed decisions in the context of the
# explore-exploit trade-off.

# # Solutions
#
# You will likely find solutions to most exercises online. However, we
# strongly encourage you to work on these exercises independently without
# searching explicitly for the exact answers to the exercises.
# Understanding someone else’s solution is very different from developing
# your own. Use the lecture notes and try to solve the exercises on your
# own. This approach will significantly enhance your learning and
# problem-solving skills.
#
# Remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
# understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you
# encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with
# different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during
# class discussions.
#
# Later, you will find the solutions to these exercises online in the
# associated GitHub repository, but we will also quickly go over them next
# week. To access the solutions, click on the Github button on the lower
# right and search for the folder with today’s lecture and tutorial.
# Alternatively, you can ask ChatGPT or Claude to explain them to you. But
# please remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to
# understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities.
#
# *Continue to the next tutorial to tie all previous concepts together in
